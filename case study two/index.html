            <p class="opening-para">The challenge of this project was to create a delivery tracking
                flow for a logistics company. When tracking a package, 
                especially internationally, consumers prefer as much
                information, regarding the whereabouts and timeline of delivery, 
                as possible. The aim of this application is to efficiently
                provide these details in a reader-friendly format.</p>

                        where it is at any given time, and what stage it is up to- and every package no matter the cost is tracked.
                        Ally Express in the worst in my opinion because there is never any tracking information. I get an email 
                        sometimes saying it has arrived in my country, but there’s no timeframe attached to that. So it could arrive 
                        in my country, and be another week or two weeks, and there is no way to know. Plus, I can’t see if it’s left 
                        a given country to estimate when it’s going to arrive.</i></q> <br>

                    <p class="section-one-para">I conducted primary research through several interviews. I interviewed 
                        a diverse audience, focusing primarily on individuals who had prior experience 
                        shipping internationally. It was almost unanimous that these consumers wanted tracking 
                        information that was detailed, accurate, and included updates regarding customs.
                        <br>
                        Taking this into account I identified important aspects of 
                        my design.
