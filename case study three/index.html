            <p class="opening-para">
                The challenge of this project was to create an app for social good and a 
                corresponding non-profit website. Aiming to reduce food waste and 
                alleviate hunger in communities this app addresses the problem markets 
                face when they do not have the logistical support they need to donate 
                unsold produce rather than compost. The app is created to utilize 
                the existing produce delivery routes and logistical system, leveraging 
                these established routes and systems to simply accommodate one 
                additional stop at a food pantry.<br>

                    <p class="section-one-para">For the beginning of this project I conducted secondary research. From a high level view this project 
                        was informed by  reading about designing for social change. First, we must recognize the complex interplay between systems and humans.
                        Every time individuals act they contribute to the running of the system in which they exist with their neighbors. Other aspects of designing 
                        for social change are agency, access, and action. More specifically, designing for access requires utilizing the tools and services readily 
                        accessible within one’s day-to-day life. Taken all together, we are trying to design for individuals by meeting them where they are, and giving 
                        them the power to take action easily. What does this mean for our app? Let’s take a look. Here, I explain the lower-level workings of our app. 
                        I wrote this piece to feature on the non-profit website.

                        <blockquote><p class="line-skip">Our organization works within the produce distribution area -truck dispatchers, their delivery drivers, 
                            and food markets.</p><p class="line-skip">Truck dispatchers optimize delivery routes for efficiency using logistics software. Our technology aims to work with 
                            existing logistics software.
                            
                            Building on the principles of access, agency, and action our <span class="stop">Stop For Your Neighbor</span> application is designed to meet
                            the user where they are, show them an easy route for meaningful change, and inspire action.</p>

                            logistics software. The app is loaded with the produce delivery route information you already planned. 
                            It also has access to your contacts. </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">It analyzes your current route data and suggests the nearest added stop at a food pantry - which you can then add 
                            to the route (it will update the route on the software too).</p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">It uses the contact list to coordinate the response, all within a couple of clicks through the app. </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">First, the dispatcher learns there are opportunities to reduce food waste simply by adding a stop at a food pantry to their 
                            drivers’ existing routes. The food pantry stop is calculated to be extremely time efficient. The stop is less than a mile off 
                            of the existing routes. </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">Next, via the contact list, a message is sent to the markets that if they have any produce close to expiring the truck will be 
                            making a stop that day for the food pantry. The grocers are then asked to prepare, by setting aside the food for when the 
                            truck arrives, rather than sending it to be composted. </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">The driver is notified so that the truck, after fresh delivery, waits to receive the unsold produce. </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">From there the food pantry is notified that they will be receiving produce, and can notify their customers it is best picked up 
                            and eaten that day.  </p>
                            
                            <p class="line-skip">The app coordinates this entire response quickly and efficiently. By utilizing the current delivery system and software, 
                            inspiring action within the existing working system, we hope to create change. Our goal is to show an improved community
